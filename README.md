# 👋 Hi, I'm MAHADI HASSAN

I’m not a programmer. I don’t know how to code.  
But I had a big idea — to create a powerful, hacker-focused, beautiful, and easy-to-use Linux OS called **Fireworks OS**.

I used **ChatGPT** to help bring that idea to life.

Everything — from the design, logo, system tools, hacking suites, AI assistant (called "Sparks"), terminal commands, UI design, to manuals — was fully built by ChatGPT based on my guidance and imagination.

---

### 🔥 What I Did:

- 🧠 I imagined and guided the vision of Fireworks OS.
- 📋 I told ChatGPT what I wanted, step by step.
- 🎯 I focused on making the OS user-friendly and hacker-focused.
- 🌐 I made sure the OS supported both **Bangla** and **English** — and more!

---

### ⚡ What ChatGPT Did:

- Developed the full OS based on Ubuntu Minimal
- Created a full suite of hacking and bug bounty tools
- Designed the UI, terminal, command helper sidebar
- Built Sparks — the AI assistant that understands Bangla, English & more
- Wrote the entire user manual in both Bangla and English
- Ensured top-level security and performance

### 🤝 Special Note

> This is not just a project. It’s proof that even without programming knowledge, if you have a vision — and the right AI assistant — you can create something powerful.

Thanks to OpenAI's ChatGPT for helping me turn my imagination into reality.
